JS pseudocode:

0. Examine the JSON response from the Autocomplete API (Paste the URL in a tab).
-identify how you will grab the data from here.
-identify how you will do callback=? for JSONP, use ('cb') 
ISSUE: cb != callback and we need to see how jQuery can handle this (custom callback parameter)


1. On click of button:
	a) get the string typed in ny the user
	(Alert/Console.log it so we can make sure our variable has the data). 
	b) Get JSON results of cities -> data.
		i) on success of that, capture the data in a variable (again, console.log it to see if b4 you move on. This is a good opp to examine the data in Chrome Console.)
		http://autocomplete.wunderground.com/aq?query=vanc
		^vanc = the variable.

		var results = data["RESULTS"]; 
		-loop thru the results -> result(for each result)
		((callback is just called cb in weather api.))
